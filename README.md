# YELP-DATA-ANALYSIS

In this project, the goal is to help consumers and existing and new merchants to use Yelp more
efficiently.I have analysed two restaurant businesses: Mon Ami Gabi and Chipotle. Performed text
mining and done sentimental analysis. Also for each restaurant I have figured which is the most talked
about dish of the restaurant. They also can have a better overview about the restaurants on features that
the restaurants are famous for or needs to improve on by looking at the keywords, which helps them to
choose places that they would mostly like to dine in.
